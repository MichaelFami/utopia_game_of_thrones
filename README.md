Recreating a simpler version of Utopia browser strategy game
This will have themes from game of thrones provided by the api at https://anapioficeandfire.com/

I will endeavor to add the mechanics for the player to spend resources on buildings that generate more resources which lead to building an army and then fighting other armies. ie with D amount of gold I can afford to build X farms which yield Y bushels of food per day which can then feed Z number of army units. Or build X number of houses which yield Y amount of gold per day in tax revenue etc.
If that proves to be too ambitious I will stick to just creating the mechanics on the battles between the armies and I will assign different sized armies to each house based on the size of their military in the books. 

There are wiki pages which provide the military formulas that Utopia uses and the general yields of each building type but I will have to figure out how to translate that to code. 


Allowing for multiple players might be too much of a stretch goal so I think the game will be player vs computer. Although getting the computer to make strategic decisions may prove more difficult to code then letting a second player make choices. 

I have included some images showing what the game looks like on the browser. I will be shooting for something similar but with Game of Thrones theming.
